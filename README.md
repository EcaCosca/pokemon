* This repo for my first project in Tuwaiq academy whitch is an website that display the current weather of cities.

## Functionalities in the website:
* to know the pokemon.
* search for your pokemon.
* add your pokemon to your faverot.

## Tools used:
* Bootstrap: CSS framework for developing responsive website.
* Trello: Project management tool to orgnize the time and work.
* Figma: Wireframing thats help me to design my website befor jumpping into coding
* pokemon data API: an API that can access pokemon data for 892 pokemon.

## Problem encountered:
* hoseing the API: It took me one day while search and try more than one API to get the appropriate API, and then I choice pokemon data API because it is an anime , so I liked that.
* Find good design: In fact, I have no experience in designing interfaces, but I tried to make the user interface simple and easy to use, and figma helped me with that.
